The following models were used with the given parameters.

LogisticRegression(C=0.01, class_weight={-1: 0.833, 0: 1.667, 1: 0.833})
MultinomialNB(class_prior=[0.4, 0.2, 0.4])
LinearSVC(class_weight={-1: 0.833, 0: 1.667, 1: 0.833})
RandomForestClassifier(class_weight={-1: 0.833, 0: 1.667, 1: 0.833}, max_depth=3, random_state=9)

Accuracy was used for 5-fold cross validation, but the classification report was also reported using precision, recall, and f1-score.
